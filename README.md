# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow for my Software Development class.

Iâ€™m an Automation Developer and student pursuing an Associate of Science in Application Development & Data Analysis. 

Outside of work and school, I like being a little creative, whether through coding projects, website design, or personal interests like showcasing my pets.
